# Basic Commands

Here are some commands that we can use to be faster when we are working

## Directories

`mkdir {Directory Name}` mkdir is the abreviation for make directory, to use it correctly we only need to type this followed by the directory name.

`rmdir {Directory Name}` rmdir is the abrevation for remove directory, to use it correctly we only need to type this followed by the directory name.

## Navigate

`cd` We can use cd followed by the route we want to go to move throghout the directories.

## Compare 

`cmp` It is used to compare the two files byte by byte and helps you to find out whether the two files are identical or not.

## Find files, folders and inside files

`find {Route} {Name or extension}`This is kind of difficult to explain so we have this example: find /home/example-username/ -filename_example

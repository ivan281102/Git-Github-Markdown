# Basic Commands

Here are some commands that we can use to be faster when we are working

## Directories

`mkdir {Directory Name}` mkdir is the abreviation for make directory, to use it correctly we only need to type this followed by the directory name.

`rmdir {Directory Name}` rmdir is the abrevation for remove directory, to use it correctly we only need to type this followed by the directory name.

## Navigate

`cd` We can use cd followed by the route we want to go to move throghout the directories.

## Compare 

`cmp` It is used to compare the two files byte by byte and helps you to find out whether the two files are identical or not.

## Find files, folders and inside files

`find {Route} {Name or extension}`This is kind of difficult to explain so we have this example: find /home/example-username/ -filename_example

## Create and edit files

`nano` There are a lot of ways to create and edit a file but here we have nano because as my way to see, is the easiest, just type nano followed by the name of the file we want to create or edit.

## Get the state of the computer 

`lscpu`At least in Linux, which is the operating system I use, this command is useful to see the state of the computer.
